    I decided early on that I wanted to try and get this project done within three days, meaning I would be left with just one or two projects to do in October. After starting it thought, seems that it may be a bigger challenge than I initially thought. Technically the functions of the site are all things I've worked with before, but having everything split up between three different sites might be a nightmare. I'm sure after I've done it a bit it won't be so bad, but the initial setup here is kinda insane.

    I think the coil in my vape was all burnt out yesterday, making me prematurely tired. Or maybe it's the vast amount of vaping I'm doing. 

    Steps for today are; add account/sign-in/sign-out logic, add commenting to posts, and then make a seperate site for posting which also has a sign in. If I can get those mostly done in a day, I think I can get some acceptable styling and polishing done tomorrow, and move on to the last NODE.js project.

    Basic functionality is DONE. There's something about building an app split between three sites that need to fetch to and from eachother that is a fucking nightmare. I'm hoping the final project for this section lets me just go back to the old way. Maybe I'm just doing to much new stuff all at once, and this will seem completely reasonable very shortly.

    Honestly, outside of the JWT shit which I basically jerry-rigged, most of this stuff is kinda straightforward. Within like 15 minutes I've got like buttons working on both comments and posts with DB integration.

---To-Do---

-origin validation
-update fetch routes
-change form action route
-better in window sign in error messages
